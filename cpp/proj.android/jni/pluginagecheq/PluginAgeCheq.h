         *
         *  @param rtn If the method made a good round-trip to the server and back, this value will be “OK”.
         *  If the method failed for some reason, this value will read “FAIL”.
         *  @param rtnmsg If the method failed for some reason, this value will hold a brief explanation of
         *  why it happened. If the method made a good round-trip to the server and back, this value will be
         *  empty.
         *  @param apiversion The version of the AgeCheq API used to fulfill requests.
         *  @param checktype The values will correspond to the following types:
         *          0 = Normal check call
         *          1 = Normal check as a result of a throttled call
         *          2 = All data forced to “allow” as a result of a throttled call
         *  @param appauthorized If the game or app is authorized by an adult for use by a child under 13,
         *  the value will be true. If the game or app is not authorized by a parent, or if the device is not
         *  yet registered this value will be false.
         *  @param appblocked If the game or app is authorized by an adult for use by a child under 13,
         *  but the game is temporarily blocked by the authorizing parent the value will be true. If the game
         *  or app is authorized by a parent and they do not have the blocking switch on the value will be
         *  false.
         *  @param parentverified The values indicate the following statuses:
         *          0 = Not verified
         *          1 = Fully verified via payment or form
         *          2 = Partially verified via EmailPlus, SMS, or VOIP
         *          3 = All data forced to "allow" as the result of a trial call and
         *              the trials value will be incremented
         *  @param under13 This field will be true if the user identified by the AgeCheq PIN
         *  has a birthdate that makes them currently under the age of thirteen based on information
         *  provided to the AgeCheq Parent Dashboard.
         *  @param under18 This field will be true if the user identified by the AgeCheq PIN has
         *  a birthdate that makes them currently under the age of eighteen based on information provided to
         *  the AgeCheq Parent Dashboard.

         *  birthdate that makes them currently under the age of set by the developer for the application
         *  in the Developer Dashboard. If this custom age is not set, this field will always be a false.

         *  (https://developer.agecheq.com) to use Application Trials, this field will return the number
